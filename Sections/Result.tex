\section{Result}
The density plot shows a homogenized water column down to 50 m where it then starts to show pycnoclines in the denser bottom water early spring. This vertical stratification is stable until the end of April where the water column starts to become more stratified, showing pycnoclines closer to the surface. In August the water is fully stratified with pycnoclines showing up at 18, 25, 50, 53 and 60 m. In beginning of September the water column is starting to lose the upper pycnocline at 18 m and in October the water is homogenized down to 30 m. The temperature is showing a similar distribution to that of the density, with a homogenized temperature distribution down to 50m in April where is shows a thermocline. The temperature starts to rise and in the end of July the water is showing strong thermoclines at 18 m, 25m, and a smaller patch of cold water at 45 m before it gets to the same temperature as in the column of water between 25m-45m. In October the water still shows a thermocline at 18 m but with colder water in the upper layer and a thermocline starting to build up again in the deeper waters, this time with colder water in the middle layer and warmer water at the bottom. The salinity is following the trends of that of density and temperature, with haloclines starting to form in the upper layer water in spring. Chlorophyll is showing a change in concentrartion in the upper water layer down to around 30 m in early March beinning of April with the highest concentrations showing up at 0-15 m of depth. The chlorophyll is then homogenized in the water column between early April until end of May where it start to shown an increasing concentration again at between 0-15 m. This concentration band is increasing through that of June, with the highest concentrations at 25m.
