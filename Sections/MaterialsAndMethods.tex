\subsection*{\crule[blue]{.2cm}{.2cm} Glider setup}
Two SeaExplorer gliders manufactured by Alseamar (France) completed a transect of \SI{40}{km} from \SI{55.57}{\degree}N and \SI{16.43}{\degree}E to \SI{55.25}{\degree}N and \SI{15.98}{\degree}E between March 5, 2021, and October 5, 2021. 
Each glider performed around 1500 dives up to a maximum depth of \SI{80}{m} per mission. 
Every dive took 20min and covered a horizontal distance of \SIrange{300}{400}{m}. 

\\ 
Gliders were equipped with sensors measuring temperature and salinity (RBR Legato sensor), fluorescence (Wetlabs ECO Puck FLBBCD - EXP sensor), and \emph{photosynthetically active radiation} (PAR) (Seabird OCR504i sensor). 
The Wetlabs sensor emits light at \SI{470}{nm} wavelength, and detects fluorescence emission of chlorophyll at \SI{695}{nm}, and phycocyanin. 
The Seabird OCR504i sensor measures PAR in the range between 400 to \SI{700}{nm}\supercite{ACSA2014}.

\subsection*{\crule[blue]{.2cm}{.2cm} Data}
Preprocessed data was made available by the supervisors of this project. Preprocessing comprised the correction of the thermal lag error in the data of the glider's conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensors.
The thermal lag error results from spatial and temporal discrepancies between temperature and conductivity measurements\supercite{Garau2011}.

Wind speed data comes from the Climate Data Store\supercite{era}. 
To estimate wind stress, we selected the $u$- and the $v$-components of wind at \SI{10}{m}above the surface. 
The $u$-component represents the east wind direction and the $v$-component the north wind direction\supercite{era2}. 
We further limited the data set to the spatial section between \SI{55.58}{\degree}N, \SI{16.44}{\degree}E, \SI{55.25}{\degree}N and \SI{15.90}{\degree}E, and the period between March 2021 to October 2021. 

\subsection*{\crule[blue]{.2cm}{.2cm} Analysis}
We analyzed the data in Python. 
Using the GSW package, we calculated the potential density from salinity and temperature assuming a pressure of 0 dbar as reference\supercite{gsw}. 
Total wind speed at \SI{10}{m} height above the surface $U_{10m}$ can be evaluated as $U_{10m}$ = $\sqrt[]{u^2 + v^2}$. 
According to Mehrfar et al. (2018)\supercite{Mehrfar2018}, we calculated the drag coefficient with $C_{Drag} = 0.001\cdot1.2\cdot  (1.1+0.035\cdot U_{10m})$. 
Wind stress $\tau$ acts as proxy for turbulent energy exchange between water and air.
Mathematically, it can be approximated by the product of air density $\rho_{Air}$, the total wind speed at \SI{10}{m} above the surface, and the drag coefficient with $\tau = \rho_{Air}\cdot C_{Drag}\cdot U_{10m}^2$\supercite{Mehrfar2018}.

\\
To improve the interpretability of chlorophyll and PAR, we log-transformed the data.
We estimated the EZD in depth where PAR equates to \SI{1}{\%} of the surface value\supercite{Lee2007}.
To assess MLD, we defined a density threshold criterion of $\SI{0.125}{kg/m^3}$ following Suga et al. (2004)\supercite{Suga2004}. 
To eliminate low quality of near-surface measurements\supercite{Suga2004}, we limited the data to a pressure higher than \SI{4}{dbar}.
