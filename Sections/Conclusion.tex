\section*{\crule[blue]{.3cm}{.3cm} Conclusion}
In summary, daily glider data from March to October show two distinct phytoplankton blooms in different vertical stratification, which can be explained by the influence of temperature and wind stress on the water layers. Light also plays an important role in the extent of the bloom, but is not sufficient to initiate a bloom.

Since the project aimed only at a coarse triage of the data, further investigation of the dataset, even at even higher resolution, will allow the dynamics of phytoplankton blooms to be studied at both small and large scales and may provide hidden insights that were previously undiscovered.
